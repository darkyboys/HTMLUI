# HTMLUI
HTMLUI2 is a lightweight C++ library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages GTK and WebKit to provide a seamless way to build native-like applications with web technologies. HTMLUI is designed for developers who prefer to use web-based UI components in their C++ applications.
